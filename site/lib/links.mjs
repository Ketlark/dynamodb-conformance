// Where each engine lives, split into a project site and its source.
//
// The suite carries one URL per target (`repoUrl`, ported in scoring.mjs) and
// it means different things per target: a code repo for the emulators, an AWS
// product or docs page for the two AWS rows. Rather than restate those URLs
// here and let the two copies drift, the split is derived - the suite's URL is
// the source when it points at a code host and the project site when it
// doesn't - and only the sites the suite has no room for are listed below.
//
// Values match each repo's own homepage field. A target with no site (dynalite)
// and a target with no public source (both AWS rows) are both normal.
