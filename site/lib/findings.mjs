// that change without the test changing, which are cosmetic edits to the title
// and which run it was measured in.
//
// Skips are deliberately not findings. A skip is the target's own feature probe
// declining because it doesn't implement the operation, which is coverage rather
// than divergence; citing one reads as a defect report for something the
// maintainer never claimed. They stay visible on the target page instead.
