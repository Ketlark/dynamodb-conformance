// Cut a release: bump the manifests, date the changelog, and hand the workflow
// the notes to tag with.
//
// The board measures the most recent release tag, so a release is what moves
// the published denominator and the dated changelog entry is what explains the
// move. That makes the cut load-bearing rather than ceremonial, and the four
// steps it used to be - bump, date, tag, write the release body - had no
// ordering beyond whatever the person remembered.
//
// The mechanics live here rather than inline in the workflow because the
// changelog rewrite is a text transform on a file whose exact shape is
// load-bearing for site/lib/changelog.mjs, and pinning that in a unit test is
// much cheaper than discovering it from a bad release. The workflow is the thin
// wrapper that runs this with credentials and does the git and GitHub work.
//
// Every precondition refuses loudly. A cut is cheap to retry and expensive to
// undo: a tag is what the board measures for the next three hours, so a warning
// nobody reads would be a warning that publishes.
//
// The two GitHub-side preconditions - the checks on the head commit, and
// whether a draft is already open - are pure functions over data the workflow
// fetches, so the rules are testable without the API.
